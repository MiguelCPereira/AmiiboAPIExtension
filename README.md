# Amiibo API Extension

A visual interface developed around a public open-source API dedicated to tracking Amiibo related data - which can be found [here](https://amiiboapi.com/).

With my extension, the user is presented with all the information the data-base has to offer, but in a much simpler and more elegant way. Searching for their desired Amiibo is also designed in an intuitive way, as the user is able to filter not only through name-searches, but also through franchise and type. Aside from that, the tool can also be used offline, as the option to switch between a local and non-local repositories is offered with the simple click of a button (switching automaticly when the net connection is lost).

I picked this specific API since the information it provides has just the right ammount of variety and depth, while still sticking within a feasible scope to package in a clean 2-screen interface. This project was developed during the Spring of 2021 and was my first experience working with API logic, as well as with Postman.

A functional version of the software is available under the "Build" folder.
